Here we have the python and sql code for the creation of the UTC Algorithm and testing it.
- The LSTM_Prediciton_Build.py file contains the function for creating the prediciton for each meter
- The Anomaly_Detection_Single_day.py file contains the function for testing the prediction against actual values to detect potential anomalies
- test.py is an example of how to implement both functions
- IEE_meter_data.sql is the sql query for retrieving the IEE data from the database
